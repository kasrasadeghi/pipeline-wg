STATUS

the great part about the scripts based design rather than the whole-thing-in-one-go design is that it's easy to make a new script that's slightly different from another one.
and we can have individual steps that allow us to change things up
but we also don't need to like make an entire website and visualization for it.

---

NEXT 
- actually visualizing the status 
- cycling the keys
- swapping IPs?

---

CORE USER FLOW

we need to be able to discover the status of the current network

then we need to be able to convert the network into the new network:
- by deploying new configs to devices already on the network
- by deploying new single-shot configs to devices that are on the LAN of the "controller" or "admin" machine and then updating the "beacon"

then we need to validate that it actually works

---

SIDE USER FLOWS

we need to be able to send qr codes to phones

we need to be able to easy add a device to an existing network

we need to be able to cycle keys for the network
- we might need to be able to non-destructively cycle keys
- we definitely need to be able to destructively cycle keys
  - where we just blow away the old network and use google drive / flash drive / qr codes / ssh to deliver keys to the new network

NETWORK TOPOLOGIES

A network session is a collection of devices that are connected to the same network. 

A network may have the following devices:
- beacon: has a public ip, used as the hub in a hub-and-spoke network
- admin: the current machine, used to administer the network
- clients: other devices that are on the same network
- server: runs the pipeline server, may be a client, the admin machine, or the beacon.

there are a few different topologies:
- server-on-admin: run pipeline server on the admin machine at home. 
    usually admin is a desktop or a rpi that runs 24/7.  you should run backups of the admin machine.
- server-on-beacon: 
    run pipeline server on the beacon machine.
- server-on-client:
    to administrate the network from a machine that is separate from the one that runs pipeline.  a bit weird, but e.g. if you're doing admin on your mac laptop and then have an rpi running the pipeline server 24/7.

you might also administrate the network by sshing into the beacon machine.
you might also also admin from the beacon machine (if it's local and it has a public ip, or if you have dynamic dns set up).

we either have to detect the network topology, or have the user specify the topology.

what about airplane mode?
- where we run the server on my laptop and connect to it with my phone
- is that even possible?
- or the reverse, where we run the server on an android phone using termux and connect to it with my laptop.  hmm

---

we may even not have a beacon.
- if we are using dynamic DNS, we don't need a beacon
- also, if we are just running it locally for dev purposes, we don't need a beacon.

FLOWS PER TOPOLOGY

TODO i guess
for now i added some scripts that do things and a way to save/load and continue a network configuration session.
you can add devices, add a phone, and do some stuff.
