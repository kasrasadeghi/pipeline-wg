this is a tool to help you manage your wireguard config.
this mirrors my own setup, where there's:
- a remote server that has a public IP that acts like a beacon for all of the devices,
- ssh access to that remote server, and
- one computer i have at home that runs 24/7.

we run this tool on the 24/7 home computer.
